# Chat2Close: The AI Sales Operating System for WhatsApp

## 1. Executive Summary
**Chat2Close** is an all-in-one AI sales platform designed to turn WhatsApp into a revenue-generating machine.

It combines a Unified Inbox, CRM, Order Management, and Marketing Automation into a single dashboard, specifically optimized for high-growth markets (including Africa) with integrations for local payments like Paystack and Flutterwave.
